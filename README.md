# Wiener Filter

An Assembly-based implementation of the Wiener Filter algorithm for image processing, developed as part of a Computer Architecture assignment at HCMUT.

## 📋 Overview

This project implements the Wiener Filter, a fundamental signal processing technique used for image denoising and restoration. 

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository demonstrates:
- Low-level programming concepts in Assembly language
- Algorithm optimization at the assembly level
- Image processing techniques
- Integration between multiple programming languages

## 📁 Project Structure

- **Assembly Code**: Core Wiener Filter implementation optimized for performance
- **Python Scripts**: Testing, visualization, and result analysis
- **C++ Utilities**: Helper functions and additional processing tools to understand the code flow and easily convert it into assembly

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jenny3306/Wiener-Filter.git
   cd Wiener-Filter
   ```

2. Install Python dependencies:
